                Hi. I'm a pixel artist. I've made the pixel art for a few modifications to Minecraft. One of those modifications is called Croptopia, and it's getting pretty close to 10 million downloads. Pixel Art is something I've noticed many people showing interest in learning, so I made this website where people can find some starting tips about the basics of pixel art so they can get started.
                If you've ever wanted to learn how pixel artists turn little squares into a unique image, you've come to the right place. Whether you want to make your own pixel art, or you appreciate pixel art and want to learn more about it, this site is meant for you. Everything I know about pixel art is a combination of self-teaching and basic tutorials much like the ones you'll find here.
                Below are some examples of my work. Feel free to check out my techniques if you like what you see!
