      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>The purpose of this site is to give some advice for making Pixel Art to the viewers, or "audience". I have met many people that are interested in making pixel art, and I happen to really enjoy pixel art, so it's a good subject for the site.</p>  <!-- change this -->


      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>This site will be good for anyone that wants to learn a little bit about how pixel art is made (the basic techniques used to make it), and for anyone that wants some pointers on how they can make their own.</p>  <!-- change this -->

        Hi. I'm a pixel artist. I've made the pixel art for a few modifications to Minecraft. One of those modifications is called Croptopia, and it's getting pretty close to 10 million downloads. Pixel Art is something I've noticed many people showing interest in learning, so I made this website where people can find some starting tips about the basics of pixel art so they can get started.
        If you've ever wanted to learn how pixel artists turn little squares into a unique image, you've come to the right place. Whether you want to make your own pixel art, or you appreciate pixel art and want to learn more about it, this site is meant for you. Everything I know about pixel art is a combination of self-teaching and basic tutorials much like the ones you'll find here.
        Below are some examples of my work. Feel free to check out my techniques if you like what you see!

      <h3>Hue Shifting</h3>
      <p>
        Hue Shifting is a very important skill for pixel art. It is the practice of shifting a color's hue in a palette (especially when shading). Generally, a color will be shifted towards a warmer hue as it gets lighter, and shifted towards a cooler hue as it gets darker. This makes the shadows look cooler and the highlights look warmer (which is what you'd expect from light).
        There are a couple exceptions to this generalized rule. For example, when hue-shifting with yellow, you can go towards green or orange for the darker shades, while for lighter shades you'd usually want to go closer to white (no hue is lighter than yellow). A similar rule applies to cyan - darker shades go towards blue, but lighter shades match white better than they match green.
        Like any other art, these guidelines are only a recommendation and do not need to be followed exactly as I explain on this page. You could reverse the direction of the shift to get an unnatural look, or you could increase/reduce the shift to better fit the look you're going for. Regardless of how you use it, Hue Shifting gives your palette a lot more depth and vibrancy, and ultimately results in a nicer image.

      </ul>
      <h3>Anti-aliasing</h3>
      <p>
        In pixel art, the canvas is a grid with a limited resolution. Pixel artists need to try and get the most out of this limited grid. This is where Anti-aliasing comes in. Anti-aliasing is a method of smoothing out jagged edges on angled lines and curves. It gets more out of the grid, allowing for smoother results without increasing or mixing resolutions (known as "mixels"). Mixing resolutions should generally be avoided.
        Anti-aliasing involves placing midtone pixels between an edge and the color(s) the edge is touching. For example if you had a black line on a white background, you would use gray pixels for anti-aliasing. This color acts as a "half pixel" without actually changing the resolution of the image. There are many ways to handle anti-aliasing, but will generalize them into what I call "Outline Anti-aliasing" and "Inline Anti-aliasing".
        Outline anti-aliasing is the one I see most often, and involves adding pixels around the edges of a line without changing the line itself. Outline Anti-aliasing is safe and easy to learn and use. Inline Anti-aliasing is similar to Outline Anti-aliasing, but sometimes pixels are replaced instead of added. It's more difficult to do correctly, but when applied well the original shape and form of the line is better preserved.
        It's worth noting that Anti-aliasing is not always necessary, and when it is used it doesn't always need to be applied to every line in a piece. Sometimes it's only needed on a few pixels, to deal with a few particularly jagged lines or to smooth a transition between colors. Also, overuse of Anti-aliasing can sometimes lead to obvious lines (known as "banding") that break the illusion of pixel art.
        While you can see the pixels in a piece, pixel art generally tries to hide the grid itself. Overuse of Anti-aliasing can also add a lot of unnecessary "noise" to a piece. Noise is unnecessary information that distracts viewers from the intended picture.

        There will be decorative frames around images and 4 images will be present rather than just 2. I have nothing I want to put in a footer right now. Depending if it looks better I may add a big headline saying "welcome to RGB-Pixels" or something along those lines.
