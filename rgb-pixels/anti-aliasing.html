                In pixel art, the canvas is a grid with a limited resolution. Pixel artists need to try and get the most out of
                this limited grid. This is where Anti-aliasing comes in. Anti-aliasing is a method of smoothing out jagged edges
                on angled lines and curves. It gets more out of the grid, allowing for smoother results without increasing or mixing
                resolutions (known as "mixels"). Mixing resolutions should generally be avoided. Anti-aliasing involves placing midtone
                pixels between an edge and the color(s) the edge is touching. For example if you had a black line on a white background,
                you would use gray pixels for anti-aliasing. This color acts as a "half pixel" without actually changing the resolution
                of the image. There are many ways to handle anti-aliasing, but will generalize them into what I call "Outline Anti-aliasing"
                and "Inline Anti-aliasing". Outline anti-aliasing is the one I see most often, and involves adding pixels around the edges
                of a line without changing the line itself. Outline Anti-aliasing is safe and easy to learn and use. Inline Anti-aliasing
                is similar to Outline Anti-aliasing, but sometimes pixels are replaced instead of added. It's more difficult to do
                correctly, but when applied well the original shape and form of the line is better preserved.

                    side does not. It's easiest to see the difference it makes if you look at the eyes and ears!

            <p>
                It's worth noting that Anti-aliasing is not always necessary, and when it is used it doesn't always need to be applied
                to every line in a piece. Sometimes it's only needed on a few pixels, to deal with a few particularly jagged lines or
                to smooth a transition between colors. Also, overuse of Anti-aliasing can sometimes lead to obvious lines (known as
                "banding") that break the illusion of pixel art. While you can see the pixels in a piece, pixel art generally tries
                to hide the grid itself. Overuse of Anti-aliasing can also add a lot of unnecessary "noise" to a piece. Noise is
                unnecessary information that distracts viewers from the intended picture.
